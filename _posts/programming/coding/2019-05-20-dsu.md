# When we can use dsu:
How many vertices in the subtree of vertex **V** has some property in **O(nlogn)**
**Problem:** Given a tree, every vertex has color, Query is how many vertices in subtree of vertex **V** are colored with color **C**?
First, we have to calculate the size of the subtree of every vertice.
```
int sz[maxn];
void getsz(int v, int p) {
    sz[v] = 1; //every vertex has itself in its subtree
    for (auto u : g[v]) { 
        if (u != p) {
            getsz(u,v);
            sz[v] += sz[u];
        }
    }
}
```
