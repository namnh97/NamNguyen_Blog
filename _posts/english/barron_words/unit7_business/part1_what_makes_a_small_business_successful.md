---

* Many people enjoy shopping in large chain stores, whereas many others have a great dislike for them. Large chain stores offer a number of advantages to shoppers. However, they also have several drawbacks.
* One of the advantages of large chain stores is that they generally offer a wider selection of productions than smaller, locally owned bussinesses do. Because a chain store is owned by a large company. It has access to many more sources of products than its smaller competitions do. This allows it to offer a greater variety of products on the store shelves. Chain stores can also sell products in their stores at lower prices. One reason is that, being part of large company. It is easier for them to seek out the manufactures that charge less. Another reason is that they get discounts for buying in very large quantities.
* Chain stores also have disadvantages. They cannot offer the personalized services that small stores can. People who run small stores are very familiar with the products they sell. They can make knowledgeable recommendations to their customers, they can answer questions about the products, and they can special offer itesm. Employees in chain stores, on the other hand, usually know very little about the items they sell. They often cannot help customers beyond telling them in which part of the store something is located.
* Chain stores make things more convenient for shoppers, but they also have; the effect of making things less personal. A place that has a balanced mix of large and small stores. If it exists, would offer shoppers the best of both worlds.
