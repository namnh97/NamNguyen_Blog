* Modern medicine has made it possible for people to live longer lives. Drugs have been developed to cure many common diseases and alleviate many **chronic conditions**. This has obvious benefits for individuals,, but the benefits for society are a bit less certain.
* Because of modern medicine. people nowadays not only live longer but live healthier lives, too. Fewer people die young of **communicable diseases** because there are drugs to cure or prevent such diseases. The lives of many older people are enhanced by medicine that prevents or controls many of the conditions that can cause illness in the elderly.
* Modern medicine has enabled many people to have many more years to enjoy their lives. Most individuals would agree that this is desirable outcome.
* On the other hand, more people living longer means that **a larger fraction of** society is made up of older people. If many of these people are past retirement age, that means they are no longer making an economic contribution to society. However, they still require support for themselves. Many people living longer also means that the populaton is larger. The longer people live, the more resources they use, and society must find a way to provide for their needs.
* Moderen medical science aims to help people to live longer lives and healther lives, too. This is a good thing in many ways, but it is a situation that also has many complications.

### SPEAKINGS
1. A lot of money is spent on investigating drugs. Do you think it is desirable to spend so much money on developing new drugs, or should more money be spent on other areas of health care?
2. What do you think are some of the most important health issues to target?
3. What do you think is the best way to combat common but potentially dangerous diseases such as influenza?

---

* I think it is important to spend money on investigating new drugs. of course. After all, drugs can cure many diseases and alleviate many conditions. But we also need to think about prevention. It would be a good idea to spend more money on educating the public about things that can be harmful to the health. such as smoking, or drinking too much, or eating junk food. There is education about those things. but people still smoke and drink and do other things that are unhealthy. People need to really understand the effects of bad habits. Too many people have chronic diseases because they drink too much or eat the wrong kind of food. I really think education is an importnat part of health care.
* I think when people live healthy lifestyles. They get sick less frequently. I think targeting dietary and exercise habits is really important. Lack of exercise and a poor diet can have different kinds of negative outcomes. For example, they can lead to obesity, being overweight, which can cause heart disease. Poor diet can also leed to diabetes, which is a serious health problem. I think encouraging people to eat well and exercise frequently are important areas to focus on.
* Doctors can give injection that prevent influenza, so everyone should get these injections. That is the easiest way to combat this disease, and many other diseases, too. There are injections to prevent many of the most common diseases. People also need to be educated about good habits to prevent spreading disease, such as washing their hands, or staying home if they are sick. There are some common diseases, such as the common cold, that can't be cured or prevented with an ejection. Scientists need to keep investigating these diseases until they discover a way to cure them.
