* Because of modern medicine. people nowadays not only live longer but live healthier lives, too. Fewer people die young of **communicable diseases** because there are drugs to cure or prevent such diseases. The lives of many older people are enhanced by medicine that prevents or controls many of the conditions that can cause illness in the elderly.
* Often people are interested in visiting these sites because it is a popular thing to do. They are not drawn to a place out of respect or appreciation for what it represents. They go because everyone else goes or because they want an interesting adventure. Therefore, education is very important. People need to understand the meaning and value of these ancient sites and the impact that tourism **has on** them. This is an important part of preserving these sites. Then, if accecc to the sites is restricted, perhaps people will understand the reasons why and will not protest it so much. Whether or not the general public agrees. However, everything possible must be done to preserve archeological sites.
