The chart shows about two groups of patients who were suffering from mild cognitive impairment. Each group followed a program of one hour of daily exercise for six months. But they did difference kinds of exercise. Group A did aerobic exercise, and Group B did non-aerobic exercise. The chart shows changes in mental capacity in each group after six months of exercise. Group A showed improvement in two areas: thinking speed and word fluency. Capcity in memory did not change. Group B had a much worse experience, because there was deterioration in all three areas. This information shows that aerobic exercise can have positive effects on metal capacity for patients improve their memory, it appeared to at least stave off deterioration in this area. Non-aerobic exercise had no positive effects, and the patients' mental capacity continued to deterioration during the study.

### SPEAKING

1. Do you find that exercise improves your mood? What others things do you do to feel better when you are in a bad mood?
2. Now that researchers have found links between exercise and improved brain capacity, do you think exercising will become more popular? Why or why not?
3. Because exercising has so many health benefits, do you think more should be done to stimulate people to exercise more?

* I think that excercise improves my mood. I play soccer often with my friends, and I always feel really good **afterward**. Of course, there are other factors. It's great to spend the time with my friends, and if we win a game. that makes me feel really good. But I think the exercise affects my mood, too. Even if I **go for** a run by my self. it puts me in a better mood. Other things that help improve my mood are listening to music. If it's happy music. Of course, or energetic music. Sad music would only make me feel worse. Watching funny movies usually helps me feel better, too.
* I am not sure if improving brain capacity will make exercising more popular. Exercise won't make you smarter, at least I don't think it will: it just slows the deterioration of the brain as you get older. That's probably important for older people, but younger people are more interested in other things. Some people like to exercise, but a lot of people don't, or they don't have time for it. I don't think this research will change that. I think people will just keep doing whatever they did previously. Some will exercise and others won't, depending on whether or not they enjoy it.
* Personally, I think exercising is important and I try to get regular exercise. However, I also think it's up to each individual to choose whether or not to exercise. All the information is there. Everybody knows the benefits of exercise or can easily **find them out**. If some people choose not to exercise, they're the ones who have to live with the results of that. They might have poor health or be more depressed or something like that. but it's their choice. I think information should always be made available, but after that, each person has to decide what he or she will do with that information.
