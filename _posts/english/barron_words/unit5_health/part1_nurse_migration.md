They provide a supply doctors and nurses in these countries are much lower than the salaries paid in Country C and Country D, which are destination countries. The salaries in Country A are much lower even than the salaries in Country B. In Country B, nurses earn **ten times as much as** in Country A. The difference in doctors salaries is even greater.
* The difference in salaries between the source countries and the destination countries is greater still. Nurses in Country D, for example, earn almost ten times as much as nurses in country B. Doctors in Country D earn almost fifteen times as much as doctors in Country B. It is easy to see why source countries have a hard time retaining health care professionals.

* I am journalist. I chose this profession for several reasons. First, I like to write and always have, ever since I was a small child. I am also interested in politics and current events. I like to **keep up with** what's happening and analyze different political situations, and I love telling people my opinion about things. As a journalist, I get to do all these things that I really love; write, follow the news, and tell people my opnion, It's great!
* Because I am just **starting out** in my profession. I hope things will change a lot for me over the next decade. Right now I have a job as a reporter for a small newspaper in my city. I hope that in ten years I will be working for a much larger newspaper. I also hope by then to be working as a foreign correspondent, reporting the news from abroad. That's really my biggest goal.  think I can make it in ten years.
* My profession offer a lot of opportunities for working abroad. A lot of people are lured to journalism because they are interested inn travelling to other countries. As I mentioned. That is a primary goal for me, too. Some journalists live abroad and report the news regularly back to the newspaper in their own country. Other journalists don't live abroad but travel regularly, depending on where the news is happening. There is always important news happening all over the world. So journalists get to travel a lot if that's what they want to do.
