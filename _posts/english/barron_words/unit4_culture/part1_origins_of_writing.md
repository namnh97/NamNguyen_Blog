### SPEAKING 

1. Do you believe that it is better to have a teacher who specializes in the subject he or she teaches or a teacher who is highly skilled at teaching? why?.
2. What skills do you think are necessary to teach today's children to help them function in a society where technology is changing so rapidly?

* Of course it would be best to have a teacher who specializes in the subject **being taught** and is also very skilled at teaching, but if I had to make a choice. I think I would choose the one who is skilled at teaching. Of course, I assume that this teacher would have a **certain amount of knowledge** about the subject, I think the best teachers are the ones who make their students want to learn and can show them how to to learn. If you know how to learn, you can find any information you need. And if you want to learn, you will look for that information. So a teacher might not know every **last piece of information** about something, but a good teacher can help the studen **figure out** how to find that information. I have had teachers who knew a lot about their subjects but who were so boring that I learned very little from them. **To me** it didn't matter what they knew. They still didn't help me learn about it.
* Cleary, the most basic skills children need to learn to function in modern society are computer skills. **Computers in today's world are like books have been, or were**. Nowadays, computer literacy is as important as reading and writing. Child have to learn how to use different kinds of software and how to find information on the internet and things like that. **But I also think there a skill even more basic than that that we need to function in modern society**. That skill is the ability to change rapidly. Teachnology changes rapidly, and we have to **keep up with** it. Today, we use computers in a certain way. But a few years from now everything might be different and we will have to adopt new methods of work and communication. What we teach children in school today might not be completely useful by the time they graduate. Learning the skills of changing is as important as anything else.
