The chart shows ticket sales at National Theater for the six-month period from January through June. The most popular group of performances during that time was the National Mime Troupe. Five thoudsand tickets were sold for their performance titled 'Humorous Situations". **Only half as** many tickets were sold for the performance of Carmen. **put on by** the City Opera. That was the least popular of all the performances listed on the chart. The second least popular performance was "Works of Beethoven" by the National Symphony Orchestra, with 3.000 tickets sold. The "Rock Stars Live!" concert and the Swan Lake ballet were **both almost as** popular **as** the "Humorous Situations" mime performance. There were 4.750 tickets sold for each of those performances. Opera and classical music do not appear to be very popular forms of entertainment at the National Theater. People appear to prefer less serious forms of entertainment such as humorous mime and rock music.

* I usualy perfer to see humorous performances. I like to see funny things and hear jokes. If I spend the money and time to go to the theater to see a live performance, then I want to have a good time. I want to laugh. I want to relax and forget about my worries. I actually enjoy serious performances, too. The most important thing, really, is to have the chance to watch skilled performers. But I choose to see humorous performances more often than serious ones.
* My country is small. We have some renowned actors and musicians whom we really love, but they are known only to people in our country. They aren't famous in other places. We also enjoy performers from other countries.  We like the famous Hollywood actors and musicians from different places. We like all the international starts. just like people everywhere.
* I like both kinds of movies. I like real stories and made-up ones, but I particularly enjoy movies that portray real events and people from history. I enjoy seeing what life was like during a different period in history. I like to see what the houses looked like, the clothes, the towns and cities, all the details of daily life. I especially enjoy movies that show those details and show them correctly, that make the effort to really show what life was like. Historical events are interesting to learn about. But to me learning about the details of daily life in the past is even more interesting.
