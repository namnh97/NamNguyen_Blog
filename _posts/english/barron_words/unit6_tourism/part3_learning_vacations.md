The chart shows the percentage of the total number of studens who enrolled in different types of courses during the summer of 2010. The most popular type of course was cuisine. Thirty-five percent of students enrolled in cuisine courses. Science and philosophy had the lowest enrollment, at 5 percent each. In general, the creative types of courses had higher enrollments. Cuisine, photography, painting and drawing are all courses where students learn how to do creatives things. **Taken all together**, these courses made up 80 percent of the total enrollment. The courses with more serious content, on the other hand, were much less popular. History, philosphy, and science are all academic types of courses, the kinds of things one might study in a colleage degree program. Only 20 percent of students signed up for these courses. Perhaps during the summer people prefer to spend their time taking a more relaxing type of course.

* I'm from coast, so the cuisine of my city is all about seafood. We have a lot of different fish dishes. We are famous for a special kind of seafood **stew** that we make. We enjoy this dish on all our national holidays. There are also different kinds of baked fish dishes that are famous in my city. We have a variety of seafood dishes and tourists always eat them when they come to our city.
* **Different kind of fish, of course, are the most common ingredients in our cuisine**. Almost all our traditional fishes contain garlic. So that's another common ingredient. Also, we eat almost everything with rice. Beside that, because it is a tropical area, we have a lot of tropical fruits that we use in our cooking - mangoes, coconuts, things like that. They are common ingredients in stew and soups as well as in desserts.
* We still enjoy the traditional fish dishes that our city has always been famous for, but we use more modern cooking methods now instead of cooking over a fire, people usually cook on a gas **stove** or in a microwave oven. People now have more access to ingredients from other places, for example, different kinds of spices that are common in other countries - people in my country are used them now, too. They are not **traditional flavors** for us, but they are becoming more common in our cooking. I think in the past, people ate the traditional dishes more often, maybe even everyday. Now we're so busy, we don't have time to cook as often, so we eat those traditional dishes less often, maybe once a week or even once a month. In the future. I think this will be even more true. People will eat more fast food and more frozen food from the grocery store. They will have less and less time to cook the traditional dishes, and maybe they will even forget how to cook them. I hope not, but it could happen.
