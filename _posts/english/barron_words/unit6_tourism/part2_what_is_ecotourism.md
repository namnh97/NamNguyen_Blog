The charts show whether or not three different cruise companies follow certain environmentally friendly practices, and they compare this information in two different years: 2000 and 2010. In 2000, two of the companies were already recycling most of their waste and avoiding dumping wastewater into the sea. These companies were Sun Cruises and Water World Tours. The Sea Adventure company did not follow these practices. None of the three companies had systems to reduce air pollution in 2000, and none of them avoided traveling to places wih delicate underwater ecosystems. By 2010, all three companies had made changes to become more environmentally friendly. In fact, in that year, two of the companies, Sun Cruises and Water World Tours, were followed all the practices shown on the chart. Sea Adventure was recycling waste and avoiding dumping waswater into the sea, but they still did not have a system to reduce air pollution and still traveled to destinations with delicate underwater ecosystems. Sun Cruises and Water World Tours are probably more attractive to people who are interested in ecotourism than Sea Adventure is.

* I always choose to spend my vacations somehwere in the wilderness. I live in a big city, and I am surrounded by crows and noise all the time. so when I am on vacation. I want to be in a really quite place. I try to find as remote a place as possible. I like hiking and camping in the mountains. Once I went on a rafting trip on a river. Really, I am happy spending my vacation anywhere out in the woods.
* When I travel, I void any place with crowds. That doesn't mean just cities. Some national parks can get very crowed, too and then you don't feel like you are in the wilderness. I try to avoid taking my vacation in the summer because that's when everyone else travels and every; place is crowded. I like to travel in the fall. It's a beautiful time of year, and it's much easier to avoid crowds then.
* Luxury accommodation are not important to me. In fact, they make me feel a little comfortable because I am not used to them. I like everything plain and simple and especially inexpensive. My favorite place to stay when I'm traveling is in my tent. For one thing, it's inexpensive. For another, it allows me to be in the middle of nature. I go to sleep at night to the sound of the wind blowing through the trees above me. I wake up in the morning surrounded by birdsong. What could be better than that?
