### WRITING

1. Large numbers of visitors endanger sensitive archeological sites such as Machu Pichu. In your opinion, it is more important to try to preserve such sites or to allow public access to them?

* The preservation of archelogical sites is extremely important. The reason is quite simple. Once they are gone, they are gone forever. Those who hope to preserve such sites need to provide education so that public understands their importance.
* Archeologicals sites contain buildings and objects that have been around for a long time, for thousands of years in some cases. They provide us with a connection to past civilizations, to the people who came before us. They contain valuable information about our ancestors and where we came from. If we lose this information, we lost the possibility of learning many things about our history. It is terrible to think that something that has **lasted** for thousands of years can be destroyed in a relatively short period of time by the **idle curiosity** of modern tourists.
* Often people are interested in visiting these sites because it is a popular thing to do. They are not drawn to a place out of respect or appreciation for what it represents. They go because everyone else goes or because they want an interesting adventure. Therefore, education is very important. People need to understand the meaning and value of these ancient sites and the impact that tourism **has on** them. This is an important part of preserving these sites. Then, if accecc to the sites is restricted, perhaps people will understand the reasons why and will not protest it so much. Whether or not the general public agrees. However, everything possible must be done to preserve archeological sites.
