### WRITING

1. In your opinion, why is the circus still a popular form of entertainment in the modern electronic age?

---

* These days technology has made it possible for us to be entertained with out even leaving our home. TV, DVDS, and Computers can provide us with endless hours of entertainment. It may seem strange that people still like to go out to see live performances such as a circus. The circus, however, can provide things that electronic entertainment can not.
* I think the most attractive aspect of the circus is that, **compared with** the electronics we are used to. It seem **exotic**. Seeing a circus is very different from the things we are used to seeing and experiencing in our daily lives. We do not normally get to see live animal. Especially trained ones that perform, or real people who dress in funny clothes and do difficult tricks. In ancient times, circus audiences may have been awed to see things they had never even heard of. In modern times, we have heard of these things and have probably even seen them on TV, but we rarely get to see these interesting things in real life.
* Going to the circus is a special experience because it is different from the things we normally do. We get to leave the house and go to a special stadium or circus tent. We get to hear all the sounds and smell all the smells and eat all the special circus junk food that is sold before the performance. I takes us out of daily experience and transport us for **a short while to a different world in a way that** electronic games or TV shows cannot. It is something that is not available to us everyday, and that makes it even more special .
* Even though we live in a world filled with modern technology, the circus can still offer us a special and exciting experience.

* In my city, there are a lot of different forms of entertainment. There are movies, theaters concerts, and nightclubs. It is a big city, so you can find almost anything to do that you want. I suppose a special forms of entertainment we have is the summer theater festival. During the summer, there are live theater performances in the park. Some of the shows are free, and others you have to buy tickets for. When festival time **comes around**, almost everybody goes to at least one of the performances. That is one kind of entertainment we have that is very popular; and everyone talks about it. During the winter holidays, we also have a series of concerts that a lot of people enjoy. Other than those special events, people in my city almost just enjoy the usual kinds of entertainment that people everywhere like.
* I definitely prefer to see live entertainment. I really enjoy going to concerts, and nothing beats seeing a live concert performance. It really makes a difference to be in the same room with the musicians and to be able to watch them as they perform. It is a totally different experience from listening to record music. For music, seeing a live performance is really important. For other kinds of entertainment, it doest not matter to me as much. Going to a play in a theater or watching a movie on TV is all the same to me.
* I like to play the guitar, but I do not think I can say that I am very talented at it. I wish I were, but I enjoy it anyway because I love music. I do not have any other performing arts talents. I have some artistic talents, though. I like to paint and draw, and I am trying to develop those talents more. I take arts classes occasionally. That is about all the talents I have.
