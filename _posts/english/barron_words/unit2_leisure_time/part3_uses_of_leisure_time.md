* One of my favorite pastimes is going to the movies. I really enjoy movies of all kinds. I like drama and comedy and action movies. I like going to the movies with my friends and then talking about the movie. whether or not we liked it and why, what we thought about the actors. How i compares with other movies, things like that. It is really interesting. So I think I could say that is my favorite pastime. I also like to read, I enjoy watching sports, and sometimes I play a little tennis.
* I enjoy both physical and intellectual activites. But I guess I prefer intellectual activities a little more. As I said, I love discussing movies. I also like talking about books I read or article I read in the newspaper. It is great to send an evening in a cafe with my friends and talking about these kind of things. But physical activities are important, too. Maybe I do not do them everyday, but I like to get some exercise a few time a week. I like to play tennis or sometimes just **take a walk**.
