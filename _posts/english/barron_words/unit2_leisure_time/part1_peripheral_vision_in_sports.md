### WRITING

1. Do you believe that professional athletes make good role models for young people.

---

* People everywhere like watching sports. Many top athletes are admired through out their countries, and some even have fans all around the world. These athletes are good role models for young people. In many ways, although in some ways they can also be a bad example.
* Top athletes get the attention of young people. Most children and teenagers like to follow professional sports. Professional athletes become heroes to them, and children want to be like their heroes. This means that they will want to play sports, which is good for their health. Playing sports also teaches important lessons such as teamwork and learning how to lose(and win) gracefully. Professional athletes also demonstrate the important of working hard for your goals, of practicing regularly to become good at something. This is a good example for children to follow.
* However, professional athletes are not always good role models. One thing, the most famous athletes get paid very high salaries, much higher than most normal people can expect to earn. They also get a lot of attention, not only when they play their sports, but in other parts of their lies as well. This can lead children to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports. Children might focus more on these aspects than on the fun of the game or on the challenge of learning how to play well. Then there are those athletes who behave badly. For-example, some take drugs to improve their performance in their game. This kind of behaviour sends the wrong message to children.
* Professional athletes can be very good role models for children, as long as they focus on the positive aspects of playing sports.

* I know that someone find noise distacting. But I actually prefer to study in a noisy environment. I don't know why. When things are quiet, somehow I seem to notice that. It distracts me in a way. But when there is some noise around me. I don't mean loud noise like a rock concert or anything like that. But when I hear people talking in the next room, or people walking down the hall, just people going about their normal activities around me. I feel comfortable. I guess then I know I am not alone. That feeling of having people around me actually helps me focus on my studies.
* Like I said, **being in** a noisy environment isn't distracting me. But sudden loud noises, such as the telephone ringings or a car **horn honking**, really bother me, then it takes me a few minutes to get my focus back and go on studying. Also, as I mentioned before, quiet can be **distracting to** me. If there are no noises around me, no people talking or no cars rushing by, I notice the lack of noise. I just don't like it. That's why I don't really like to study at the library. It is too quiet!
* I anticipate a big, big change in my study situation. For one thing, I will graduade in few months. That is a major change. Then, I am hoping to be able to go to graduate school. I am working on the applications now. So it will be a while before I find out whether I am accepted at any of the schools. All the schools I am applying to are in other countries, so maybe a year from now I will be living in a foreign country. That would be a huge change. If I don't get accepted at any of schools, then I will have to find a job and work for a while and apply to gradute school again. Whatever happens, by next year my life will be very different from what it is now.
