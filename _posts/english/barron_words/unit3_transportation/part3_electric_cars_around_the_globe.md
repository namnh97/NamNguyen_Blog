* If more people drove electric cars, that would help solve some of the problems created by **gasoline-powered** cars. I believe that money, convenience, and education are three major factors that would persuade more people to drive electric cars.
* Money is a powerful incentive. If electric cars are cheaper to buy than gasoline-powered cars, then people will become interested in them. If electricity is cheaper to use than gasoline, then people will want to own electric cars. Clearly, gasoline is becomming more expensive every day. If car manufacturers can produce electric cars cheaply, then the monetary incentives will be in place and more and more and more people will start buying electric cars.
* Convenience is almost as important as money. Electric cars need to be easy to use for them to be appealing. If **putting a charge** in car battery is as easy or easier than filling up the tank with gasoline, then people will find electric cars attractive. If electric cars are small and easier to park than larger gasoline-powered cars, that would be another attraction. If people see electric cars as easy to own and easy to use they will be more interested in buying them.
* The third factor is education. People will become more interested in driving electric cars when they understand the problems with gasoline-powered cars. Educating the public about issues of pollution and decreasing oil reserves may persuade people to consider electric cars.
* If people believe that electric cars are cheap and easy to use and if they understand the reasons why we need to **move away** from gasoline they will be more likely to embrace them.

### SPEAKING 

1. What kind of car is appealing to you?
2. Do you prefer to live in a rural, suburban or urban area?

---

* I am not interested in cars. I just want something that will take me places. I don't care if a car has flair. I don't care if it can go really fast or what color it is or anything. I just want a car that is easy to take care of and that doesn't need repairs all the time. I know some people are very interested in cars and know all about the different models and the different things that different cars can do, but that is not me. I just need transportation.
* I prefer to live in an urban area. I grew up in the city, and I still live there. I can not imagine living anywhere else. A city has everything. It has all kinds of stores so you can buy anything you need. It has movies and theaters and restaurants. All my friends live in the city, and most of my relatives do, too, so I feel like I have everybody nearby. I don't like rural areas. They are so quiet, it make me feel afraid. And there is nothing to do. There are no stores or museums or anything. And the suburbs just seem so boring. I don't know why anybody would live anywhere that was not a city.
