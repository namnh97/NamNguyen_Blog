### WRITE

1. In your opnion, what has been the most significant transportation innovation of the past 200 years?

---

* Trains, planes, and automobiles all become common modes of travel within the past 200 years, and they have all had significant effects on the way we live. If I had to choose **which one of these three was the most significant**, I would choose automobiles. Automobiles effect the way we live and work, and they affect the way world around us looks.
* Automobiles have given us easy access to many things in our daily lives, so we have more choices about a lot differrent things. We can shop at variety of stores. For example, because we get to them by car. We do not have to shop only at the stores that are nearby. We have more choices about which doctors we want to have treat us or which lawyer we want to hire or which hairstylist we want to use because automobiles have increased the distances that we can easily travel. We have more choices about places to study or work because we can get to more places by car.
* Automobiles have also affected the way world around us looks. Because so many people depend on automobiles, there are paved roads, and parking lots everywhere. This was not true in the days before automobile. Houses, shopping malls, and apartment builds are built in **garages attached** to accommodate cars. Gas stations are everywhere. The world today looks very different than it did 100 years ago, and **much of this is because of the automobile**.
*  Automobiles have made a lot of changes in the way people go about their lives. This is why I think the automobile is the most significant transportation innovation of recent times.

### SPEAKING

1. What modes of transportation are commonly used in your city?
2. Which do you think are the most efficient?
3. What do you think are some of the advantages of train travel?
4. What do you think are some drawbacks of train travel?

---

* In my city, people generally use buses, bicycles, and cars to **get around**. In my opinion, bicycles are the most efficient mode of transportation. I say this because there's a lot of traffic on our streets, especially during rush hour. Sometimes the cars and buses don't seem to move at all because there are so **many of them**. We have terrible traffic jams. For me, however, this isn't a problem because I almost use my bike to get around. When all the cars and buses are sitting there waiting to move. I speed right by them on my bike. I never get stuck in traffic jams. I get everywhere quickly and efficiently on my bike. I really love it. The only time I don't like riding my bike it when it rains.
* I think trains are great for long distance travel. They are a lot more comfortable than buses because they have more space. You can **get up** and walk around on a train. But you can no do that on a bus. Trains are more relaxing than cars because you don't have to do **the driving yourself** and you don't have to deal with traffic jams or worry about **getting lost**. Trains usually have comfortable seats. They have large windows so you can enjoy the scenery. I love travelling by train.
* In my opinion there are very few drawbacks to train travel. Sometimes the tickets are expensive. But that depends on where you are doing. Sometimes the schedule isn't completely convenient. But don't mind changing my plans a little to fit a trin schedule. A lot of people don't like trains because they don't give you the same independence that travelling by car does. But I don't mind that.
