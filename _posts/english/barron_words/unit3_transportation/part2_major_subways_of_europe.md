The chart shows the size of three different subway systems using different measures: track length, number of stations, and number of passengers. Each one of the subway system shown could be said to be the largest one. Depending on which measure you use. The London Underground has the most track, the Paris Metro has the most stations and the Moscow Metro carries the most passengers. the London Underground has almost **twice as much track as** the Paris Metro but twenty-five fewer stations, so the stations on the Paris Metro must be much closer together. In fact of the tree systems shown. Paris the most stations but **the least total track length**. The moscow Metro carries twice as many passengers as the London Underground. Although it is only about three quarters the size of the London system. Its trains might be very crowed. Although the Moscow Metro carries the most passengers of the three systems, it has the fewest stations.

* The subway station in my city do not have interesting architecture, in my opinion. They are very modern, and I don't like that style. It just isn't warm and visiting. It isn't comfortable. It's all straight lines and no pretty decorations. Our train station, on the other hand, has very beautiful architecture. It's an old building and was build in the classical Geek style which I like very much. It has columns and statues of mythological figures. It's a very interesting building to look at.
* Our city library usually has exhibits of paintings and other kinds of art by local artists. It's interesting because they change the exhibits several times a year. So there's often something new to see. I think this is a great way to use space in the library, because a lot of people go there. They get to see what artists in our community are doing. I think there's alos work by local artists in our city hall, but **the problem with that** is the most people don't go there very often. They don't have a reason to go there, so that art doesn't get seen by as many people. The library is a better place. Subway stations would be a good place, too, because most people use the subway. However, in this city, there isn't any artwork in the subway stations, unfortunately.
