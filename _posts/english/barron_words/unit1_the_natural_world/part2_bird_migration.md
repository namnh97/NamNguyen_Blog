The chart shows a list of some of the species of birds that can be seen in woodchuck country in two different seasons: winter and summer. Information is given about eight different species of birds. Three of the species listed-cardinals, crows, and woodpeckers are observed in both summer and winter. That means that they are properly not migratory birds but live in the region all year. They can tolerate the winter weather in that area. Four of the species listed bluebirds, mocking birds, orioles and vireos are observed only in the summer. They must be migratory birds that travel to woodchuck country for their breeding season and spend the winter in another place where the weather is warmer. One species of bird - juncos is seen in woodchuck country in the winter but not in the summer, Perhaps it migrates father north in the summer for its breeding season.

### READING

* Many people enjoy observing birds because they find them fascinating. Why do you think people are fascinated by birds?
* Are you fascinated by birds? why or why not?
* What animals are fascinating to you?
___

* I think people are fascinated by birds because they seem so free. They can fly. So it seems like they can go anywhere. People can not fly and are stuck on the ground. So birds are very different from us in that way. Some birds are also very beautiful. Some are very colorful. Swans are very graceful. So I think it people are also fascinated by birds because of their beauty.
* I am not particularly fascinated by birds. I live in the city. So I don't see any interesting birds around me in my everyday life. I just see those brown and gray city birds. They are not pretty. They are **a bit dirty**. So I do not like them. If I lived somewhere there were more interesting birds, probaly I would not be interested in them.
* I am not fascinated by animals in general. But I am a little bit interested in pet cats. I think they have very nice lives. They nap all day on a soft chair or in the sun, and then in the evening they get fed. They just nap and eat. They can chase mice if they feel like it. They can do whatever they like. What a life!
