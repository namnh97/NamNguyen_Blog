* The charts show about information about the size, rainfall, and temperatures of three deserts on three different **continents**. At 9.000.000 square in area. The Sahara desert in Africa is much larger than the other two deserts showns. The Taklimakan at 270.000 square kilometers, and the Great Basin, at 305.755 **square kilometers**, are similar to each other in size. The Taklimakan has **the sparest rainfall**, with an average of 1 to 3.8 centimeters per year. The three deserts have similar summer temperature of 13* c  in the Sahara and Great Basin Deserts and 25* c in the Taklimakan Desert. However, Winters in the Sahara, with an average temperature of 13* c, are much warmer than in the other two deserts, where the average winter temperatures are -8*  c and -9* c. The highest temperatures record in the shara and great basin are almost the same 57* c and 58* c. The other extreme, the lowest recorded temperature, is not shown for those two deserts.

* I do not think I would like to go to the top of a high mountain because I do not like to be cold. And I think climbing high mountains like Moun Everest is dangerous. It might be intresting to visiting a desert because I would like to see the different kinds of plants that grow there. I think they would be very unusual and interesting to look at. But I do not like to be too hot. Either, So I would not want to stay in the desert for a long time. I do not really like extreme environments. I prefer to be comfortable.
* I think people like extreme environments for two reasons. One is adventure. Some people like doing unusual or dangerous things. They want to see if they can climb to the top of high mountains or endure extreme hot or cold. They want to prove how strong they are and how much they can endure. The other reason is interest. Some people are interested in studying unnusual plants or animals or rocks, different kinds of things, So they have to go unusual places to find these things.
* I can adapt easily to new climates as long as they are not extreme! in the winter time it is very cold in my city. If I have the opportunity, I like to take a vacation at that time and go to warm place with a nice beach. I certainly can adapt easily to a warm beach climate, Especially when I think about the cold weather I have left behind at home! however, I do not like to go anywhere that is too hot, or too cold either. I can not adapt so that.
