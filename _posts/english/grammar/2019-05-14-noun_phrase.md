* The ring is beautiful
  * The beautiful ring broke because of you 

# Trick 2: Using participle 
* The potato has grown.
  * The grown potato sells very well.
* The clock is ticking.
  * The ticking clock never works.
# Trick 3: Making nouns from verbs - another way of compacting information.
* This is call **NOMINALISATION**. There is a tendency in English - especially technical English - to represent events, qualities of objects and qualities of events not as verbs, adjectives and adverbs but as nouns.
* Ex:
  * to own -> ownership.
  * to move -> movement.
  * to grow -> growth.
