# Tip 1: Background Strategies.
Strategy:
1. Learn words in context.
2. Have, and use, a good dictionary.
3. Use a vocabulary notebook.
4. Organise Your Vocabulary notebook.
5. Pronunciation.
6. Revision using a vocabulary notebook.
7. Start reading.

# Tip 2: Read the text first.
1. Skim-reading the text.(This gave you some ideas about the content and organization).
2. Look at the questions.
3. Go straight to that paragraph to determine the answer.

# Tip 3: Overview Read.
1. Run your eyes over the text, and think about the features, and look at a bit more closely at the first paragraph.
2. Use this to understand the text's content and purpose, and predict some of the words.
3. Think about your personal experiences or knowledge of the topic.

# Tip 4: Read beginnings and ends.
'Skimming', whicch means running your eyes over the text, picking up the important words and phrases, and receiving an idea about the general nuture of each paragraph.
# Tip 5: Check for Signposts.
- Signposts show you how to go from the start of the writer's argument 
1. Words which show sequence or oder, such as 'another', 'the next issue', and 'the other purpose'.
2. Conjuntions or conjunctive phrases, usually at the beginning or near the middle of paragraphs, and connected to the group of sentences that follow. An easy one is 'for example', 'introducing a series of sentences which give an example'. Others phrase are: 'However', 'futhermore', and 'in addition'.
3. Transition sentences or phrases, which often can replace simple conjuntions. These announce the end of one subject and the beginning of the text. For example: 'Other raod accidents are caused *less by speeding, and more by* the design of the road', announcing the change of subject from 'speeding' to 'road design'.

# Tip 6: The Quick Read Approach.

* Step one: Read the heading, any sub-heading, or introduction statements, and few words around the text.
    1. Think about the topic. Predict the contents.
    2. Try to understand the text organization and purpose.
    3. Say some of the words related to the topic.
    4. Think of your own personal experiences.
* Step two: Look at the first paragraph.
    1. Read the first sentence.
    2. Read this paragraph in a little detail(since, as an introduction, it should give a good idea about the contents, purpose, and organization of the text).
    3. Check for any introductory 'organizing words', such as: "There are three factors to consider'.
    [It is probably a good idea to quickly write down the main topic/theme beside the paragraph, to help with scanning later on].

* Step three: Look at the second paragraph.
    1. Read the first sentence.
    2. Look over the paragraph, searching for, and circling:
        a. organizing words[Forexample, '...two reason...']
        b. Signpost words and conjuntions[For example, 'The first is...', 'Another...', 'However', and 'In addition to this...']
        c. proper nouns(that is, nouns which start with a capital letter).
        d. a few 'noun phrases'.
        e. dates and figures.
    3. Quickly look at the last sentence to see if it gives a concluding though/summary of the paragraph, or a 'segue' to the next paragraph.
* Step four: Look at the next paragraph, and repeat step three(and so on).


# Tip 7: Know about conjunctions:
We are looking at conjunctions that show relationship of ideas within senteces. These conjunctions may appear anywhere - and anything that shows relationships between thoughts is very important to us in order to follow the thoughts of the writer.
