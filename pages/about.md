<p align="justify">
Hi! I am Nam Nguyen. My major is <b>Computer Engineering</b> at
<b>University of Information Technology</b>.
I am not a writer or a expert.
I know that I can not remember all of my learned knowledge.
So I want to write this post in order to help me improve my
writing skill and collecting the learned knowledge to be able to review in my future.
I hope this blog can help me become a better person and learning more knowledge. ^^!
