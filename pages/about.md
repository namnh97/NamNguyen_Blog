Hi! I am Nam Nguyen. My major is <b>Computer Engineering</b> at
<b>University of Information Technology</b>.
I know that it would be impossible to remember all of the learned knowledge so I want to write this one in order to help me improve my
writing skill and gain more knowledge.
Hoping that It could help me get better in my future. @@!
